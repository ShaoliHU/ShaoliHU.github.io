I am currently a third - year Master's student at the [RAP Lab](https://rap-lab.github.io/) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. Zhongqiang (Richard) Ren. My research direction focuses on Multi - Agent Path Finding Among Movable Obstacles. 

I graduated with honors from the School of Robotics Science and Engineering at Northeastern University (Shenyang) in 2023. During my undergraduate studies (2020–2023), I conducted research at the Ocean Heart Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Hongli Xu](http://www.rse.neu.edu.cn/2022/0304/c2263a210401/page.htm).

Between February 2023 and May 2024, I was a core member of a startup team incubated at XbotPark Innovation Camp and MiraclePlus. Our project explored integrating AIGC with holographic projection to enhance human-computer interaction. The team secured seed funding (now exited), and I contributed to developing the real-time gesture recognition system that enabled intuitive user interaction with holographic avatars.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of Robotics, Multi-Agent Systems, and Large Language Models — particularly in grounding language in spatial understanding, robotic manipulation, and building world models for embodied AI.
